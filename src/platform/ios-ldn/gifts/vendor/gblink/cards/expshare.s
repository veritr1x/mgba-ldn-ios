@ Exp. Share for the whole party. `install` starts a V-blank hook that shares
@ a battle's EXP. the way later games do: each party Pokémon that battled the
@ fainted Pokémon gets all of its EXP., not a share of it, and every other
@ one that isn't an Egg and hasn't fainted gets half. The battle engine runs
@ one script command a frame, and between frames the hook looks at the next
@ one; for getexp it changes what the command works with:
@ - before the step that works out the EXP., the hook does that step itself:
@   EXP keeps what the fainted Pokémon gives (yield × level / 7, as the game
@   has it), a held EXP. SHARE's own share becomes 0 (the whole party gets
@   EXP. anyway), and the Pokémon to give it to start from the first.
@ - before the step for each party Pokémon, its value: EXP for one that
@   battled, half of it for another, which is then marked as having battled
@   so that the step gives it.
@ The step then adds its own boosts (a trainer's Pokémon, a traded Pokémon,
@ a LUCKY EGG) and the EVs, levels up and learns moves as it does for the
@ EXP. SHARE. In Emerald's battles beside a partner, the partner's Pokémon
@ (party slots 4 to 6) get nothing they didn't battle for. The hook is copied
@ to RESIDENT like the others, so it lasts until the game is reset;
@ clearing ENABLED turns it off.
